I am making a Motorcyle app that connects people that ride and people that would like to learn to ride, showing things like potential dangers, and other tad bits that drivers may or may not know. Overall it should show safety and cool riding features.

## Frontend

- Javascript
- React

## Backend

- Python
- Django

##

Users should be able to login and view riders in categories from experianced motorcycle riders and novice motorcycle riders.
